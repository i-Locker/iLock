iLockers fill the need to store value for periods of time.
Owners, holders, project leaders could make use of iLockers to lock-up and save token(s) and or fungible coin(s) for a duration of time.

Example:
Project BitcoinPlus wants to lock 1,000,0000 USDC to show locked value and prove project is sustainable.
BitcoinPlus operators interact with iLocker smart contracts, or DApp;

(following along with this example) steps:
1) BitcoinPlus Approves iLocker Factory to transfer 1,000,000 USDC.
2) BitcoinPlus calls to CreateLock(), iLocker Factory deploys a new iLock smart contract, known as a holdingContract, && transfers 1,000,000 USDC to the new holdingContract.
3) BitcoinPlus calls withdraw() to claim deposits after the unlockTime (specified during iLock deployment)

iLockers provides the communty a decentralized, fully autonomous "Locker" strategy to employ individually or through enterprise.
